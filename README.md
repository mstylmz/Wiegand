# 26 Bit Wiegand Protocol

What is the Wiegand Protocol? 

Also known as the Wiegand interface, the Wiegand Protocol is a cabling standard for access control systems and card readers.

Card readers are used to connect fingerprint scanners or other biometric readers to each other and to the rest of the access control system.

How does the Wiegand Protocol work?

In Wiegand format there are two data paths, Data0 and Data1. As shown in Figure 9, these paths are normally found at high levels and fall to zero in the presence of information.
