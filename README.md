# 26 Bit Wiegand Protocol

What is the Wiegand Protocol? 

Also known as the Wiegand interface, the Wiegand Protocol is a cabling standard for access control systems and card readers.

Card readers are used to connect fingerprint scanners or other biometric readers to each other and to the rest of the access control system.

How does the Wiegand Protocol work?

A Wiegand card uses two short cables that store data magnetically on the card. When drawn through the card reader, the cables transmit either the high or low voltage signal as 1 and 0, respectively, so that the scroll is generated a binary data line to authenticate the card's credentials.
